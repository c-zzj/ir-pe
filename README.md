# IR for Simpler Language Design

This is a Scala implementation of an intermediate representation (IR) for simplifying the process of designing a language. 

The project currently consists of several IR transformations (support for closure, SSA conversion) and code generation to LLVM. For details, see [description](https://github.com/c-zzj/ir-pe/blob/main/desc.pdf).
